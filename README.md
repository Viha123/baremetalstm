# Board: STM-32F466 

## Goal: 
- Learn more about Baremetal programming and microcontrollers
- I'm following these tutorials to first get the LED to blink and then make a simple UART
- I want to try and implement the important peripherals on my own and learn as much as I can!
## Links to Tutorials:
- [Bare Metal Programming Guide Github](https://github.com/cpq/bare-metal-programming-guide?tab=readme-ov-file)
